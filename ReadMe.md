# GovHack 2014 Project - "EnergyCalculator"

Jonathan Moffatt and Wai Liu

- Want to know what those energy star ratings mean in dollar terms?
- Want to know how much money your appliances cost to run?
- Want to know how much you could save by upgrading to more efficient appliances?

Our project is an energy calculator tool which will answer those questions for you. 
You can enter all of your household's appliances and your personal usage patterns, 
compare energy costs between your appliances and run "what if" hypotheticals by 
bumping up the energy efficiency of your appliances and seeing what you save.

Developed in 48 hours for GovHack 2014.
